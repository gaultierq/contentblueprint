<p>The <strong>Collective Editorial Calendar</strong> was designed to facilitate a coordinated and efficient content production process across multiple Ubisoft teams. The goal was to create a structured action plan for sharing knowledge internally, highlighting thought leadership, and producing high-quality, actionable content. The calendar was governed by my team, ensuring consistency, relevance, and alignment with Ubisoft&#39;s priorities.</p>

<hr/>

<h3 id="the-calendars-purpose"><strong>The Calendar&#39;s Purpose:</strong></h3>

<p>The editorial calendar supported over eight internal Ubisoft teams, as well as external contributors such as subject-matter experts and thought leaders. It provided a centralized location for teams to plan, track, and manage content creation for <strong>The Collective</strong> blog.</p>

<p>The <strong>key objectives</strong> of the calendar were to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establish a <strong>content action plan</strong> that included problematics, content types, and deadlines.</li>
<li>Align content with Ubisoft&#39;s <strong>strategic priorities</strong> and key expertise areas.</li>
<li>Provide <strong>clear publishing guidelines</strong> to ensure consistency and high standards.</li>
<li>Organize and manage contributions from a wide variety of <strong>teams and thought leaders</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h3 id="content-guidelines"><strong>Content Guidelines:</strong></h3>

<p>The calendar formalized content creation by outlining several key guidelines that contributors followed to ensure quality and alignment with Ubisoft&#39;s knowledge-sharing goals:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Global Access:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Content must be accessible and valuable to all Ubisoft employees globally.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> <strong>Expertise-Focused:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Articles must share, highlight, or discuss different areas of expertise within Ubisoft, showcasing internal knowledge and talent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> <strong>Examples &amp; Case Studies:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Content should be practical and useful, providing real-world examples, use cases, or post-mortems to make it applicable to teams&#39; work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> <strong>Original Content:</strong>

<ul>
<li>The focus was on sharing content created <strong>by Ubisoft, for Ubisoft</strong>. External resources were only shared as references or supplementary materials.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> <strong>Usefulness:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Every piece of content must help readers learn something new, understand Ubisoft&#39;s strategic priorities, or provide actionable takeaways that teams could implement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> <strong>Actionable Knowledge:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Content needed to be informative, relevant, and easy to act upon, whether through practical steps or inspiring ideas for implementation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="features-of-the-editorial-calendar"><strong>Features of the Editorial Calendar:</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hot Topics Action Plan:</strong> The editorial calendar included a <strong>hot topics section</strong> where trending themes, critical content areas, and emergent discussions were identified and formalized with deadlines, targets, and content formats (e.g., post-mortems, case studies, explainers).</li>

<li>Research-based articles</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Guiding Pillars:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Content in <strong>The Collective</strong> had to follow five key guiding pillars:</li>
<li> <strong>Global</strong>: Accessible and relevant to Ubisoft&#39;s worldwide teams.</li>
<li> <strong>Expertise</strong>: Focused on sharing expertise.</li>
<li> <strong>Examples</strong>: Practical and useful content.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Planning:</strong>

<li>Weekly editorial meetings were held with representatives from various teams to discuss upcoming content, new ideas, and content ready for publishing. This ensured that all contributors were aligned and had a voice in the content strategy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Contributor Management:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Teams were encouraged to contribute based on their expertise. <strong>The Collective</strong> calendar tracked each team&#39;s progress, deadlines, and the format of their contributions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
