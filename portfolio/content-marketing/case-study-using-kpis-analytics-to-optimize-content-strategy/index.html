<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Measuring the impact of content is essential to refining strategy, enhancing engagement, and ensuring that audiences find value in what is being produced. This case study explores how content KPIs and analytics were leveraged to assess performance, audience engagement, and strategic outcomes.</p>

<p>This methodology was developed and implemented at Ubisoft, where I applied structured analytics to track content effectiveness, audience behavior, and engagement patterns. By measuring metrics such as reach, interaction, knowledge application, and conversion rates, content strategies were continuously optimized for better discoverability, consumption, and impact.</p>

<h2 id="key-objectives">Key Objectives</h2>

<p>The primary goals of this analysis were to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify how different types of content performed across platforms.</li>
<li>Measure audience engagement and interaction.</li>
<li>Evaluate content utility in knowledge application and strategic alignment.</li>
<li>Optimize future content strategy based on insights.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="methodology-tracking-analyzing-kpis">Methodology: Tracking &amp; Analyzing KPIs</h2>

<p>A comprehensive KPI framework was developed to track both quantitative and qualitative metrics across multiple content formats, including written content, videos, case studies, and interactive experiences.</p>

<h3 id="key-metrics-analyzed">Key Metrics Analyzed</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement Metrics:</strong> Clicks, likes, comments, shares.</li>
<li><strong>Reach Metrics:</strong> Unique visitors, views by location, job family segmentation.</li>

Articles and videos with clear calls to action achieved 15–20% more clicks. Visually rich, well-structured content improved completion rates and retention.</p>

<p><strong>Optimization:</strong> Balance concise information with engaging formats to sustain interaction.</p>

<h3 id="2-knowledge-application-content-utility">2. Knowledge Application &amp; Content Utility</h3>
