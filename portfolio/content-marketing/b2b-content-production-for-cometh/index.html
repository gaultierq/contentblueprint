<p>At <strong>Cometh</strong>, I developed a comprehensive editorial calendar and content production pipeline as the sole person responsible for content creation and communication. With no prior experience in blockchain tech or marketing, I navigated these challenges by closely collaborating with the development team to ensure accuracy and relevance in the content I produced. My role encompassed both strategic planning and hands-on content creation to ensure consistent, high-quality output.</p>

<hr/>

<h4 id="process-and-methodology"><strong>Process and Methodology:</strong></h4>

<p><strong>1. Learning the Technology and Industry:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I began by meeting with the development team to understand the blockchain technology we were using fully, the tools we were building, and how these aligned with industry standards.</li>
<li>I conducted a <strong>competitive analysis</strong> to understand how similar companies in the blockchain space were positioning themselves:

<ul>
<li>What types of content they produced.</li>
<li>The communication mediums they used.</li>
<li>How they positioned their products and key messaging strategies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Content Categorization:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>After gaining a solid understanding of the industry, I worked closely with the <strong>CTO, developers, and developer advocate</strong> to establish content categories that aligned with our B2B activities and technical tools:

<ul>
<li><strong>Alembic General</strong></li>
<li><strong>Account Abstraction (tool)</strong></li>
<li><strong>NFT Marketplace</strong></li>
<li><strong>Indexer/Relayer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rollup</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Collaboration with the Development Team:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I maintained <strong>regular meetings</strong> with the development team to stay up-to-date on product developments, verify technical content, and brainstorm ideas for new content.</li>
<li>I also <strong>engaged developers</strong> in contributing to content creation, such as writing developer how-tos and contributing to product demos.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h4 id="content-strategy"><strong>Content Strategy:</strong></h4>

<p><strong>4. Brainstorming Content Across Three Axes:</strong> I devised a content plan focusing on three key axes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quick Content:</strong> Fast-turnaround, such as tweets, short announcements, and social media posts.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Content:</strong> More in-depth pieces that required research, such as case studies, product demos, and technical blogs.</li>
<li><strong>Content Reuse:</strong> Repurposing existing content to maximize its reach and value, such as creating shorter clips from longer videos for TikTok or turning interviews into blog posts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Types of Content Produced:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I produced a range of content formats:

<ul>
<li><strong>Case Studies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Demos</strong></li>
<li><strong>Announcements</strong></li>
<li><strong>Product Descriptions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Long-Form Blogs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong></li>
<li><strong>Social Media Content</strong> (LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Format &amp; Medium:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I utilized various formats to communicate the content, ensuring it was shared across multiple platforms:

<ul>
<li><strong>Blog posts</strong> for in-depth content.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong> for product demos and interviews.</li>
<li><strong>Social media posts</strong> for quick updates and announcements (Twitter, LinkedIn).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Time to Market:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I evaluated each piece of content based on its <strong>&quot;time to market&quot;</strong>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Quick wins:</strong> Shorter pieces like announcements or tweets that could be produced and published quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term content:</strong> More complex pieces requiring coordination, research, and production time (e.g., videos, technical blogs).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h4 id="execution"><strong>Execution:</strong></h4>

<p><strong>8. Content Planning and Execution:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I structured a content plan spanning <strong>3 to 4 months</strong>, aiming to post one piece of content every weekday. This plan ensured that content was consistently shared, leaving room for <strong>urgent and timely posts</strong> such as partnership announcements or product updates.</li>
<li>I prioritized:

<ul>
<li><strong>Steady content flow:</strong> Pre-scheduled posts for consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Space in the calendar for last-minute, high-priority announcements.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The content and communication strategy I developed for <strong>Cometh</strong> provided a steady flow of content. It allowed the flexibility to handle real-time updates, ensuring the company remained agile and responsive. The mix of <strong>quick wins</strong> and <strong>long-term content</strong> enabled us to maximize engagement and effectively communicate our products and services to technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
