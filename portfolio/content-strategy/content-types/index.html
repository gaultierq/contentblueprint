<p>For anyone working with content, the <strong>types of content</strong> produced are just as important as the content itself. They determine <strong>how information is presented, consumed, and engaged with</strong> across different platforms. Each content type serves a unique purpose---reaching different audiences, driving engagement, and supporting key marketing and product goals.</p>

<h3 id="the-importance-of-content-types"><strong>The Importance of Content Types</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Shaping User Experience</strong> -- The right content type ensures clarity, accessibility, and usability across platforms.</li>
<li> <strong>Targeting Different Audiences</strong> -- Different formats resonate with different users, from technical professionals to casual readers.</li>
<li> <strong>Driving Conversions &amp; Engagement</strong> -- Tailoring content types to user intent boosts performance and action-taking.</li>
<li> <strong>Enhancing SEO &amp; Discoverability</strong> -- Certain formats (long-form content, videos, structured data) improve search ranking.</li>
<li> <strong>Enabling Cross-Channel Marketing &amp; Repurposing</strong> -- Content can be adapted across platforms to maximize reach and efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<p>During my time at Ubisoft, I proposed the creation of an <strong>internal blog</strong> to centralize and share knowledge content. As part of the <strong>Knowledge Management team</strong>, my role involved <strong>conducting in-depth research</strong> on key trends in the video game industry. These reports helped Ubisoft teams identify weaknesses, track progress on specific technologies, and benchmark against competitors. To formalize this effort, I created <strong>publishing guidelines</strong> that standardized content production across teams.</p>

<p>Beyond internal knowledge sharing, content types vary significantly depending on <strong>platform and purpose</strong>. For example, a post on <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and one on <strong>X (formerly Twitter)</strong> might convey the same core message, but their structure and presentation need to be adapted for each platform&#39;s audience and format.</p>

<p>Here are some of the <strong>content types I used</strong> at Ubisoft and Cometh, along with a breakdown of their purpose and structure:</p>

<h4 id="blog-website">Blog/Website</h4>

<p>What it is:</p>

<p>A research content type aims to provide an in-depth analysis, evaluation, or interpretation of a single topic, based on. While it can provide an argument, it it not based on personal opinions but on evidence. It presents the history, the different aspects and a new perspective on the topic while synthesizing the current knowledge on it.</p>

<p>Structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Describe the topic in which you have conducted research.</li>
<li>Discuss the history of the topic, as well as current existing knowledge on it.</li>
