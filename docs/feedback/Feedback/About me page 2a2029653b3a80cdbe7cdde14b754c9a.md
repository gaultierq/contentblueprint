## About Me

**Content strategist & marketer focused on clarity, structure, and impact**

I’m a bilingual (English–French) content strategist and marketer with over eight years of experience helping organizations communicate clearly and consistently across teams, markets, and channels.

My background combines **content strategy, marketing, and knowledge management**, shaped by experience in both global companies and startups. I’ve led projects ranging from editorial strategy and internal communication to product messaging and campaign management.

Before moving into content, I studied **cultural anthropology**, which gave me a strong foundation in research, audience understanding, and storytelling across cultures.

I work with companies that want to align their content with business goals—whether that means building a scalable strategy, improving internal collaboration, or producing effective content that reaches the right audience.
