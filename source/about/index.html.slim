        p My background in cultural anthropology has given me strong research and analytical skills and a global perspective. This unique foundation enables me to craft authentic narratives and content strategies that resonate across cultures.

        p With over a decade of experience working in both French and English across the tech and gaming industries, I bring a comprehensive understanding of digital content creation and strategy to every project.
