### Cometh Connect

Cometh introduces Cometh Connect, the first biometric smart wallet service designed to redefine user interaction within the web3 space. Serving as an Account Abstraction-as-a-Service (AAaS), it enables users to effortlessly create, use, and manage smart wallets through biometric authentication, streamlining the complex onboarding process in web3 and removing barriers to adoption.

Cometh Connect prioritizes user experience, offering a seamless and intuitive interface that demystifies blockchain technology for both new and experienced users. The service operates on the Gnosis Safe smart contract wallet – the gold standard of the industry, safeguarding over 40 billion dollars in capital – ensuring robust security for users. 

With support for multiple biometric signers and the WebAuthn standard found in most devices today, users can control their smart wallet using FaceID or fingerprints, securely stored on their device. This feature extends to various devices, providing flexibility and convenience. Additionally, Cometh Connect introduces sponsored transactions, making gas fees invisible to end-users and enhancing the overall user experience.

Account recovery options are also available, allowing users to designate a third party as a guardian for added security. Cometh Connect stands out as a user-centric solution in the blockchain space, striving to make web3 accessible and improve user experience, driving adoption and innovation in the field.
