# Press Kit and Press Release

A **press kit** and a **press release** are key tools for brand communication and media outreach.

**Press Kit Definition:**
"A comprehensive resource that provides journalists and stakeholders with essential company details, product highlights, and visuals" to ensure accurate media coverage.

**Press Release Definition:**
"A timely announcement designed to generate buzz around a product launch, partnership, or company milestone, delivering key information in a clear, engaging format."

## Strategic Value

Together, these tools help brands accomplish three objectives:

- **Control messaging narrative** — Ensure your brand story is told accurately and consistently
- **Build credibility with media and audiences** — Provide verified information and professional materials
- **Maximize exposure opportunities** — Make it easy for journalists to cover your story

## Portfolio Examples

I created the following materials for Cometh:

- [Press Kit for Alembic](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sTzrJED1MGQHTX96cmYaosmAKhBaqgSd/edit?slide=id.p3#slide=id.p3)
- [Cometh Connect Product Press Release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NA_NJPOHw0Qub_4WxwHKgaT3Rb5w32voP_l6RenfW_Q/edit?tab=t.0)

These materials demonstrate how effective press kits and releases can position a product in the market, highlight key features, and provide journalists with everything they need to write compelling stories about new launches and innovations.
