# Videos

Here are samples of videos I created based on different needs (thought leadership content, community content, case studies and interviews) of Cometh.

For Ubisoft, the videos I made were internal-only and under NDA but below are samples of the creation and ROS of the videos that lean more towards knowledge content. You can jump to it here.

## Video Production Methodology 

At Ubisoft, I led the editorial team responsible for creating all internal knowledge content, focused on the technology, expertise, and methodologies of our production teams. My approach was to treat platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and other digital websites as our competition. The challenge was to ensure Ubisoft employees chose to engage with our content instead of external sources. To achieve this, our content needed to be high-quality, engaging, and, most importantly, informative. Here are some examples of the templates we'd work with to create videos. I led the production in terms of video goals, angles and feeling, and my video team did the rest.
