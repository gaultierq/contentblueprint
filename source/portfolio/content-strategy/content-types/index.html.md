# Content Types

For anyone working with content, the **types of content** produced are just as important as the content itself. They determine **how information is presented, consumed, and engaged with** across different platforms. Each content type serves a unique purpose---reaching different audiences, driving engagement, and supporting key marketing and product goals.

### **The Importance of Content Types** 

1.  **Shaping User Experience** -- The right content type ensures clarity, accessibility, and usability across platforms.
2.  **Targeting Different Audiences** -- Different formats resonate with different users, from technical professionals to casual readers.
3.  **Driving Conversions & Engagement** -- Tailoring content types to user intent boosts performance and action-taking.
4.  **Enhancing SEO & Discoverability** -- Certain formats (long-form content, videos, structured data) improve search ranking.
5.  **Enabling Cross-Channel Marketing & Repurposing** -- Content can be adapted across platforms to maximize reach and efficiency.

During my time at Ubisoft, I proposed the creation of an **internal blog** to centralize and share knowledge content. As part of the **Knowledge Management team**, my role involved **conducting in-depth research** on key trends in the video game industry. These reports helped Ubisoft teams identify weaknesses, track progress on specific technologies, and benchmark against competitors. To formalize this effort, I created **publishing guidelines** that standardized content production across teams.

Beyond internal knowledge sharing, content types vary significantly depending on **platform and purpose**. For example, a post on **LinkedIn** and one on **X (formerly Twitter)** might convey the same core message, but their structure and presentation need to be adapted for each platform's audience and format.

Here are some of the **content types I used** at Ubisoft and Cometh, along with a breakdown of their purpose and structure:
