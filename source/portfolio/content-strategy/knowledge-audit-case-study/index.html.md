# Knowledge Audit Case Study

**A Strategic Approach to Content Development**

In order to find knowledge-oriented subjects to treat at Ubisoft, where we do the research, create the content, and share it. I created a methodology called the "Knowledge Audit," where we spent about a month doing top-down and bottom-up research on what topics exist internally, what topics are important to Ubisoft, and what our teams lack in terms of knowledge.

We interviewed top management to understand ubisoft top priorities, and what the dev teams needed to level up on, and what was "du jour" in the video game industry. We then interviewed team leads and see whta their priorities were and what they believed their teams needed. We then conducted surveys and one on one interviews with indivdual team members to see what subjects were important to their jobs, to their goals, ect. We interviewed people from the game design team, devs, 3D programmers, writers, producers, etc. We also source topics from Ubisoft's big yearly events.

We then organized the information per categories and then topics and subtopics and with my team we brainstormed content type, angle and format. We then created an editorial calendar spanning 6 months with topics to cover, communities that exist, and key contacts for each topic and community, respectively.

The "Knowledge Audit" is a research methodology that I developed and executed during my time at Ubisoft. It was designed to ensure that our content strategy was aligned with the company's priorities and addressed gaps in knowledge across various teams. While initially implemented in a gaming context, this methodology can be applied across industries to guide content creation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.

Below, I outline the methodology in detail and explain how it can bring value to any company, regardless of industry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Methodology Overview** 

**1. Defining the Knowledge Landscape:**

- **Top-Down Research:** We began by conducting interviews with Ubisoft's top management to understand the company's overall strategic priorities and the trending topics in the gaming industry. This included discussions on industry innovations, emerging technologies, and company goals.
- **Bottom-Up Research:** Simultaneously, we engaged with individual teams and their leaders, focusing on what knowledge they felt was missing and what areas they needed to improve. We also interviewed game designers, developers, programmers, writers, producers, and more to capture a holistic view of what subjects were most relevant to their day-to-day work and long-term goals.

**2. Identifying Gaps and Needs:**

- By aggregating the input from both top-level management and ground-level teams, we identified critical knowledge gaps and areas where teams needed to "level up." We also identified key subjects emerging from Ubisoft's annual events, which helped us align our knowledge topics with the company's evolving direction.

**3. Organizing Knowledge by Categories and Subtopics:**

- After gathering data from interviews and surveys, we organized the information into clear categories, topics, and subtopics. This ensured that our content strategy was systematic and covered all relevant areas, from technical skills to industry trends.
- Below is a sample of how we categorized topics (from the "Content" section of our Knowledge Audit):

  **Content**                                         **Category**     **Who**
  --------------------------------------------------- ---------------- ---------
  Interview w/ Didier on F2P impacts on IT + vision   Business Model   A
  Infographic on Vanity KPIs                          Data             B
  Storytelling Case Study on Mobile Games             Mobile           A
  Case Study On Just Dance Next                       Platform         A
  Tailor Made on Roller Champions Social Hub          Platform         D

**4. Content Strategy and Brainstorming:**

- With the knowledge categories clearly mapped, my team and I brainstormed content types, angles, and formats that would best serve each topic. We considered:
  - Articles and case studies
  - Infographics and visual content
  - Interviews with subject matter experts
  - Videos, podcasts, and interactive workshops

**5. Creating an Editorial Calendar:**

- We built an editorial calendar to guide content production over a six-month period. This calendar ensured a steady flow of relevant content that aligned with both Ubisoft's immediate and long-term knowledge goals. The calendar included:
  - Topics to cover
  - Existing communities of practice
  - Key contacts for each topic

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Benefits to Any Company** 

The Knowledge Audit methodology offers significant advantages to any organization, not just those in the video game industry. Here's how it can benefit companies across different sectors:

- **Aligned Content Strategy:** By taking a top-down and bottom-up approach, the content strategy will always align with both leadership priorities and team-level needs.
- **Identification of Knowledge Gaps:** This methodology ensures that companies continuously identify and fill gaps in knowledge, helping teams stay competitive in fast-evolving industries.
- **Holistic Understanding of Knowledge Needs:** The blend of interviews, surveys, and event data provides a comprehensive understanding of what knowledge matters most, avoiding guesswork.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Engaging multiple departments fosters collaboration, allowing cross-functional insights to enrich content creation.
- **Customizable and Scalable:** This approach is flexible enough to be applied to different industries, company sizes, and team structures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By implementing this knowledge audit methodology, companies can ensure that they remain agile, informed, and well-equipped to tackle the challenges in their field.
