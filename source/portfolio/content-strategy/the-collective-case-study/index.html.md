**Introduction**

As Editorial Team Lead, I was tasked to enhance internal communication and knowledge sharing at Ubisoft, where we had over 20000 employees across 19 different countries worldwide. I used a content marketing approach and treated Ubisoft's knowledge as a product. It culminated in the creation of "The Collective," a platform designed to centralize and elevate the dissemination of corporate knowledge across its global teams. This case study explores the evolution from a basic internal blog to a sophisticated knowledge hub tailored to the needs of Ubisoft's diverse workforce.

**Background and Needs Analysis**

**Origin of the Need:**

- **Gap in Existing Tools:** The project was born out of a critical need to address the limitations of existing internal tools which were fragmented and lacked the capability to support structured, in-depth content essential for comprehensive knowledge sharing.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Initial feedback indicated a demand for a more integrated approach to handle diverse content types including detailed case studies, technical documentation, and collaborative materials.

**Project Vision and Strategic Goals**

- **Consolidation of Knowledge:** Centralize scattered information into a single, accessible platform to reduce knowledge silos within Ubisoft.
- **Enhancement of Internal Communication:** Facilitate a smoother flow of information and foster a collaborative culture by aligning the platform with Ubisoft's innovative ethos.

**Planning and Design:**

- **Technical Overhaul:** Transition from SharePoint to WordPress was decided upon to leverage WordPress's flexibility and user-friendly content management capabilities for a non-technical audience.
- **User Experience Design:** A key focus was placed on UX to ensure the platform was intuitive and engaging for all employees, promoting regular use and interaction.

**Content Strategy:**

- **Editorial Guidelines:** Development of a comprehensive guide that outlined the types, tone, and style of content to ensure consistency and relevance across all submissions.
- **Content Types:** A deliberate focus was placed on creating evergreen content that included lessons learned, best practices, research articles, and technical demos to ensure long-term value of the information shared.

**Implementation and Launch**

**Stakeholder Engagement and Training:**

- **Pre-launch Workshops:** Prior to the official rollout, multiple sessions were conducted to familiarize key stakeholders and potential content creators with the functionalities of The Collective.
- **Content Seeding:** Strategic seeding of initial content was implemented to ensure there was valuable material available from day one, encouraging immediate engagement.

**Challenges and Solutions:**

- **Adoption:** Overcoming the inertia associated with transitioning to a new system was a challenge, mitigated through ongoing training and visible leadership endorsement.
- **Content Quality Control:** Ensuring high-quality content involved continuous monitoring and feedback mechanisms to guide contributors.

**Outcomes and Evaluation**

**User Adoption and Engagement:**

- **Analytics and Feedback:** Post-launch reviews indicated a positive reception with an uptick in regular users and contributions from across the company.
- **Impact on Company Culture:** The Collective has been instrumental in fostering a more informed and engaged workplace, promoting transparency and cross-departmental collaborations.

**Lessons Learned and Future Directions**

- **Scalability and Integration:** Future enhancements include integrating more interactive elements and possibly AI-driven content curation to further personalize the user experience.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Feedback loops and periodic reviews are set to adapt to the evolving needs of Ubisoft's workforce.

**Conclusion**

The Collective stands as a testament to Ubisoft's commitment to fostering an innovative and collaborative culture through effective knowledge management. This platform not only bridges the informational gaps that previously existed but also enhances the way employees engage with and contribute to Ubisoft's reservoir of knowledge.
