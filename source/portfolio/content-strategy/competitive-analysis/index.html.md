# Competitive Analysis

Understanding the competitive landscape is essential for building a strong brand and content strategy. This **competitive analysis case study** shows how I evaluated 15 blockchain and adjacent tech companies to uncover positioning, audience targeting, and content strategies.

[I identified industry trends, content gaps, and messaging opportunities by analyzingÂ **key competitors across platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and websites**]. These insights shaped a tailored **content strategy, slogan development, and branding approach** to help our B2B blockchain startup stand out.

Below, I outline the research process, findings, and how I translated competitive insights into a content plan that drives engagement and growth.

When I joined a B2B blockchain startup, I had no prior experience in either blockchain technology or marketing. However, I embraced this as an opportunity to learn and contribute by conducting a thorough **competitive analysis** and building a comprehensive **content strategy**. This project involved understanding the technology, identifying target audiences, and analyzing competitors in order to craft a unique brand identity and content plan for the startup.

I created an excel sheet to track the information and the analysis includes multiple tabs with competitor breakdowns, covering key areas like:

- **Purpose and Positioning**
- **Target Audience**
- **Core Calls-to-Action (CTA)**
- **Content and Platform Analysis (Twitter, LinkedIn, Websites)**
- **Visual Branding and Slogans**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Process and Steps Taken:** 

**1. Researching Blockchain Technology and Industry:**

- I began by immersing myself in **blockchain technology**, studying the basics, and understanding how our company's technology aligned with industry standards. This was crucial to understanding our **value proposition** and differentiating factors.
- I spent time understanding how our technology simplifies blockchain onboarding, making it more accessible to companies moving from Web2 to Web3 environments.
- I identified our **three key target audiences**:
  - **Newborns**: Web3 startups just launching.
  - **Established**: Web3 companies with traction aiming to convert Web2 users.
  - **Web2 Companies**: Traditional companies venturing into Web3 projects needing the technology to support this transition.

**2. Competitive Analysis:** Once I had a firm grasp on our technology and mission, I performed a **competitive analysis** of 15 companies, both in the Web3 space and adjacent industries (e.g., developer-focused companies like GitHub).

**Key Areas of Research Included**:

- **Purpose**: What is the core mission or value proposition of the competitors?
- **Positioning**: How do they position their brand in the market? What unique selling points do they focus on?
- **Target Audience**: Who are they targeting? Are they reaching developers, businesses, or both?
- **Core CTA**: What action do they want their audience to take (e.g., sign up, book a demo, learn more)?
- **Website Structure**: How is the information on their site organized? Is it clear and easy to navigate?
- **Content Publishing Platforms**: Where do they publish content (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Medium)?
- **Video Content**: What types of videos are they producing (demos, case studies, tutorials)?
- **Content Types**: What formats do they use (blogs, whitepapers, case studies, social posts)?
- **Voice and Tone on Twitter**: Are they formal, casual, or conversational? How do they engage with their audience?
- **Voice and Tone on LinkedIn**: Are they more professional or educational in their approach on LinkedIn compared to Twitter?
- **Content on Twitter & LinkedIn**: What kind of content do they post on these platforms? Are they sharing thought leadership, product updates, or community-driven content?
- **Assets**: What visual elements (design, branding) do they use to reinforce their messaging?
- **Slogans**: How do they summarize their offering in a memorable and impactful way?

**3. Analyzing Competitors and Extracting Insights:** After compiling data on each company's approach, I systematically evaluated their strategies to understand what worked and what could be improved. This process gave me insight into:

- **What positioning is most effective** for reaching developers.
- **How Web3 companies differentiate** themselves from Web2-focused businesses.
- **Content strategies** that foster engagement and community growth.

**4. Building the Content Plan, Slogan, and Branding:** Armed with insights from the competitive analysis, I proceeded to craft a **content strategy** that would resonate with our target audiences:

- **Content Plan**: I developed a multi-layered content plan based on quick wins and long-term pieces of content. The goal was to keep content constantly flowing, while leaving room for more detailed, researched pieces.
- **Content Types**: I focused on creating a balance of blog posts, tutorials, case studies, video demos, and developer how-tos that would serve our audience's needs.
- **Slogan Development**: Based on our unique value proposition, I crafted slogans that captured the essence of our product and its ability to simplify blockchain adoption.
- **Branding**: I ensured our brand identity reflected **simplicity** and **accessibility**, in line with our mission to decomplexify blockchain for Web2 companies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Reflections on the Process:** 

- **Adapting to New Industries**: With no prior experience in blockchain or marketing, I relied heavily on research and competitive analysis to guide my strategy. This process gave me the ability to understand the landscape quickly and apply those insights to our own branding and content creation.
- **Identifying Content Gaps**: By evaluating competitors, I found gaps in their content strategies, which allowed me to focus on developing content that was **more engaging** and **developer-focused**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Application to Other Companies:** 

This process of **competitive analysis** and **content strategy development** is applicable to companies across industries. By thoroughly understanding the competition, you can position your brand to stand out, craft compelling messaging, and create content that resonates with your audience.

Whether you're in blockchain, SaaS, or any other tech field, these steps---researching the market, identifying gaps, and tailoring content---can be replicated to build a robust brand and content plan that drives engagement and growth.
