# Case Study: Using KPIs & Analytics to Optimize Content Strategy

## Introduction

Measuring the impact of content is essential to refining strategy, enhancing engagement, and ensuring that audiences find value in what is being produced. This case study explores how content KPIs and analytics were leveraged to assess performance, audience engagement, and strategic outcomes.

This methodology was developed and implemented at Ubisoft, where I applied structured analytics to track content effectiveness, audience behavior, and engagement patterns. By measuring metrics such as reach, interaction, knowledge application, and conversion rates, content strategies were continuously optimized for better discoverability, consumption, and impact.

## Key Objectives

The primary goals of this analysis were to:

- Identify how different types of content performed across platforms.
- Measure audience engagement and interaction.
- Evaluate content utility in knowledge application and strategic alignment.
- Optimize future content strategy based on insights.

## Methodology: Tracking & Analyzing KPIs

A comprehensive KPI framework was developed to track both quantitative and qualitative metrics across multiple content formats, including written content, videos, case studies, and interactive experiences.

### Key Metrics Analyzed

- **Engagement Metrics:** Clicks, likes, comments, shares.
- **Reach Metrics:** Unique visitors, views by location, job family segmentation.
- **Consumption Metrics:** Time spent on content, completion rates.
- **Conversion Metrics:** Leads generated, interactions with tools or experts.
- **Qualitative Feedback:** Audience surveys, content perception, suggested improvements.

## Findings & Insights

### 1. Measuring Engagement & Reach

Content featuring interactive elements, expert insights, and practical takeaways had higher engagement than purely informational pieces. Articles and videos with clear calls to action achieved 15–20% more clicks. Visually rich, well-structured content improved completion rates and retention.

**Optimization:** Balance concise information with engaging formats to sustain interaction.

### 2. Knowledge Application & Content Utility

Eighty percent of surveyed readers found the content useful and applicable to their work. Fifteen percent took a follow-up action, such as using a tool or contacting an expert. Case studies and best-practice guides had the highest knowledge retention rates.

**Optimization:** Expand knowledge-driven content such as tutorials, walkthroughs, and expert Q&As to enhance practical learning.

### 3. Content Discoverability & Audience Targeting

Content aligned with company priorities outperformed general-interest topics. Job family–specific content increased engagement by 25%. Improved keyword use boosted discoverability, with 90% of searched topics aligning with strategy.

**Optimization:** Strengthen internal SEO and persona-based content targeting to increase relevance.

### 4. Video & Interactive Content Performance

Live sessions such as AMAs and webinars achieved 30% higher engagement than static content. Short-form videos under three minutes had better completion rates. Clear audience callouts encouraged participation.

**Optimization:** Invest in short-form videos, Q&As, and interactive formats to sustain engagement.

## Impact & Strategic Adjustments

**Key Takeaways:**

- Content combining expert insight, real-world applications, and interactivity performed best.
- Persona-based targeting increased engagement across job families.
- Content tied to business challenges achieved higher adoption.
- Calls to action and follow-up resources drove participation.
- Optimized video formats improved retention.

**Future Focus:**

- Strengthen interactive content formats to encourage engagement.
- Improve personalization by segmenting job families and regions.
- Enhance analytics tools to refine measurement accuracy.
- Expand case studies and best-practice resources for deeper learning.

## Conclusion

By leveraging KPIs and analytics, content strategies were refined to increase engagement, strengthen knowledge application, and align with business priorities. This data-driven approach ensured every piece of content served a clear purpose—educating, engaging, or inspiring action.
