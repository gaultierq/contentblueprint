# B2B Content Production for Cometh

At **Cometh**, I developed a comprehensive editorial calendar and content production pipeline as the sole person responsible for content creation and communication. With no prior experience in blockchain tech or marketing, I navigated these challenges by closely collaborating with the development team to ensure accuracy and relevance in the content I produced. My role encompassed both strategic planning and hands-on content creation to ensure consistent, high-quality output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Process and Methodology:** 

**1. Learning the Technology and Industry:**

- I began by meeting with the development team to understand the blockchain technology we were using fully, the tools we were building, and how these aligned with industry standards.
- I conducted a **competitive analysis** to understand how similar companies in the blockchain space were positioning themselves:
  - What types of content they produced.
  - The communication mediums they used.
  - How they positioned their products and key messaging strategies.

**2. Content Categorization:**

- After gaining a solid understanding of the industry, I worked closely with the **CTO, developers, and developer advocate** to establish content categories that aligned with our B2B activities and technical tools:
  - **Alembic General**
  - **Account Abstraction (tool)**
  - **NFT Marketplace**
  - **Indexer/Relayer**
  - **Rollup**

**3. Collaboration with the Development Team:**

- I maintained **regular meetings** with the development team to stay up-to-date on product developments, verify technical content, and brainstorm ideas for new content.
- I also **engaged developers** in contributing to content creation, such as writing developer how-tos and contributing to product demos.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Content Strategy:** 

**4. Brainstorming Content Across Three Axes:** I devised a content plan focusing on three key axes:

- **Quick Content:** Fast-turnaround, such as tweets, short announcements, and social media posts.
- **Long-Term Content:** More in-depth pieces that required research, such as case studies, product demos, and technical blogs.
- **Content Reuse:** Repurposing existing content to maximize its reach and value, such as creating shorter clips from longer videos for TikTok or turning interviews into blog posts.

**5. Types of Content Produced:**

- I produced a range of content formats:
  - **Case Studies**
  - **Demos**
  - **Announcements**
  - **Product Descriptions**
  - **Long-Form Blogs**
  - **Videos**
  - **Social Media Content** (LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads)

**6. Format & Medium:**

- I utilized various formats to communicate the content, ensuring it was shared across multiple platforms:
  - **Blog posts** for in-depth content.
  - **Videos** for product demos and interviews.
  - **Social media posts** for quick updates and announcements (Twitter, LinkedIn).

**7. Time to Market:**

- I evaluated each piece of content based on its **"time to market"**:
  - **Quick wins:** Shorter pieces like announcements or tweets that could be produced and published quickly.
  - **Long-term content:** More complex pieces requiring coordination, research, and production time (e.g., videos, technical blogs).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Execution:** 

**8. Content Planning and Execution:**

- I structured a content plan spanning **3 to 4 months**, aiming to post one piece of content every weekday. This plan ensured that content was consistently shared, leaving room for **urgent and timely posts** such as partnership announcements or product updates.
- I prioritized:
  - **Steady content flow:** Pre-scheduled posts for consistency.
  - **Flexibility:** Space in the calendar for last-minute, high-priority announcements.

The content and communication strategy I developed for **Cometh** provided a steady flow of content. It allowed the flexibility to handle real-time updates, ensuring the company remained agile and responsive. The mix of **quick wins** and **long-term content** enabled us to maximize engagement and effectively communicate our products and services to technical and non-technical audiences.
