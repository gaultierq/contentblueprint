The **Collective Editorial Calendar** was designed to facilitate a coordinated and efficient content production process across multiple Ubisoft teams. The goal was to create a structured action plan for sharing knowledge internally, highlighting thought leadership, and producing high-quality, actionable content. The calendar was governed by my team, ensuring consistency, relevance, and alignment with Ubisoft's priorities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **The Calendar's Purpose:** 

The editorial calendar supported over eight internal Ubisoft teams, as well as external contributors such as subject-matter experts and thought leaders. It provided a centralized location for teams to plan, track, and manage content creation for **The Collective** blog.

The **key objectives** of the calendar were to:

- Establish a **content action plan** that included problematics, content types, and deadlines.
- Align content with Ubisoft's **strategic priorities** and key expertise areas.
- Provide **clear publishing guidelines** to ensure consistency and high standards.
- Organize and manage contributions from a wide variety of **teams and thought leaders**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Content Guidelines:** 

The calendar formalized content creation by outlining several key guidelines that contributors followed to ensure quality and alignment with Ubisoft's knowledge-sharing goals:

1.  **Global Access:**
    - Content must be accessible and valuable to all Ubisoft employees globally.
2.  **Expertise-Focused:**
    - Articles must share, highlight, or discuss different areas of expertise within Ubisoft, showcasing internal knowledge and talent.
3.  **Examples & Case Studies:**
    - Content should be practical and useful, providing real-world examples, use cases, or post-mortems to make it applicable to teams' work.
4.  **Original Content:**
    - The focus was on sharing content created **by Ubisoft, for Ubisoft**. External resources were only shared as references or supplementary materials.
5.  **Usefulness:**
    - Every piece of content must help readers learn something new, understand Ubisoft's strategic priorities, or provide actionable takeaways that teams could implement.
6.  **Actionable Knowledge:**
    - Content needed to be informative, relevant, and easy to act upon, whether through practical steps or inspiring ideas for implementation.
